                At Bill John's University, a legend has passed the ears of every student, professor, and staff member
            who has set foot on the campus. The legend tells of a binder that gives its owner the ability to perfectly 
            recall any knowledge put into it. Recently, a student has discovered what may be the first piece of the 
            binder. After all, when you went from being a C student to an A student after picking up a clip ring you 
            needed for some Heritage of Peoples notecards, you realized that the legend may be true after all. Using a 
            clue derived from the ring, you begin your search for the other two rings and the binder itself. 
            
                But you must hurry and be careful, because the Gamma Psi Zeta Bullfrogs have heard word of your discovery
            and they want it for themselves. Be on the lookout for their trademark aqua-orange scarf. In Legend of the
            Three Ring Binder, a time-based adventure game, you will search three buildings to find an item and a location 
            reveal a piece of the binder. You have been given a riddle that cryptically explains where you can find 
            the piece. 
            But you're against the clock. You still need time to study, and Psi Zeta members are looking for the piece 
            as well."
            
            Good Luck!
