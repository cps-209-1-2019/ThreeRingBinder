            Your Goal: Find all three binder rings and assemble the legendary binder.
            
            Roam the building in search of an object that will allow you to discover the next ring.
            Once you discover the correct object, a riddle will appear, telling you where to find the ring.
            After solving the riddle, move to the correct location and use the correct object there.
            
            But watch out! 
            The Psi Zeta Bullfrogs will be waiting for you, ready to whip their scarves at you. To shame and stop them, throw paper airplanes at them.
